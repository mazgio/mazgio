git checkout -b new-branch

# Act 2: The Staging Spectacle - Prepare for the Git fashion show, where all changes are runway-ready
git add .

# Act 3: The Commit Carnival - Commit your changes with a twirl, because version control can be fabulous
git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Act 4: The Sync Symphony - Sync up with the latest moves from master, because we're all in this dance together
git pull origin master

# Act 5: The Push Parade - Strut your stuff on the Git catwalk, showcasing your changes to the world
git push origin new-branch

# Act 6: The Grand Exit - Bow out with flair, switching back to the master branch for the final bow
git checkout master
